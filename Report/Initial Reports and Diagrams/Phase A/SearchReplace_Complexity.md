# Cyclomatic Complexity

### Formula

V(G) = E - N + 2P
Where:
- **E** = Number of edges  
- **N** = `Number of nodes  
- **P** = Number of connected components  

---
### Counting the Elements

- **N (Nodes)** = 20 nodes (n1 through n20)  
- **E (Edges)** = 26 edges (all arrows/transitions counted)  
- **P (Connected Components)** = 1 (single connected flowchart)  

---
### Calculation

V(G) = E - N + 2P
V(G) = 26 - 20 + 2(1)
V(G) = 26 - 20 + 2
V(G) = 8


---

### Final Result

**Cyclomatic Complexity = 8**
This means there are **8 independent paths** in the Control Flow Graph.
